What is PyTorch?
A deep learning platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed for building deep neural network models which puts Python first.

Pytorch Leverages the power of GPUs(CUDA) to perform computations efficiently. It is a Python-first framework that allows you to build deep learning models with flexibility and speed.

Why PyTorch?
- PyTorch is a Python-first framework.
- PyTorch is a dynamic computation graph framework.
- PyTorch is a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.

CUDA:
- CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by Nvidia.

PyTorch on CUDA:
- PyTorch uses CUDA to perform computations efficiently.
- PyTorch provides a wide range of tensor routines similar to NumPy.
Pytorch on TPU:
- PyTorch has support for TPU(Tensor Processing Unit) which is a custom ASIC(Application Specific Integrated Circuit) developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning.
PyTorch Tensor:
- PyTorch provides a wide range of tensor routines similar to NumPy.
- PyTorch tensors are similar to NumPy arrays.

PyTorch Installation:
